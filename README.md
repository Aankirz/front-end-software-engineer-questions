# Front End Software Engineer Challenge and Questions

You are building the landing page for a SaaS cloud application, your users need to know the following
- Username
- Tenant
- Current Location in the cloud (e.g. Home)
- Cloud Applications (e.g. Email, Storage, Photo Library, Device Catalog, Subscription Manager) they have access to


Make sure that every URL in the landing page is well-formatted, do not worry about creating target pages; they can break or encounter a 404. The goal of this exercise is to allow the user to infer as much information as possible in as little time as possible.

**Minimum Requirements**
- Access every application from the landing page
- Surface mock-data from each application (e.g. show 5 recent emails, remaining storage, number of photos, etc.)
- Actions on mock-data (e.g. delete one or more emails.)
- The action should be realized on the landing page but it does not have to survive reloads (e.g. deleted emails are removed.)
- Use Functional React

**Bonus**
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- Anything to enhance UX


You may also use 3rd party component libraries.


This is essentially a blank-paper, your solution will be evaluated on UX, adherence to react core-concepts and tools used.

NOTE: Every example mentioned in the exercise is just that, an example. You neither have to use the same features nor the same number of features. This task should take approximately 2 hours.


**We also have some additional questions that help us get more insight into a candidate:**

1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something
   you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d
   love to know why you’re proud of it.

2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a
   coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working
   on.

3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked
   it, and why we should read it.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one
   specific aspect that makes it truly great.
